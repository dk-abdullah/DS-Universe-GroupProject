# Data Structures Semester Project


## Project Summary
We developed two DS-based games in C++:
1. Train Collision Game: Manage two trains on a track, detect collisions, add/delete compartments.
2. Card War Game: Two players play a war card game with scoring and shuffled decks.


## Data Structures Used
- Singly Linked List: Compartments in Train, Deck & Player hands in Card Game.
- Array: Temporary array used for shuffling cards in Card Game.


## Key Features
- Train Game: Add/Delete compartment, Move train, Check collision, Auto-simulate.
- Card Game: Create deck, Shuffle, Deal, Play rounds, Score calculation.


## Run Instructions
1. Navigate to `src/` folder.
2. Compile using: `g++ train_game.cpp -o train_game` or `g++ card_game.cpp -o card_game`
3. Run: `./train_game` or `./card_game`
4. Follow on-screen menu options.
